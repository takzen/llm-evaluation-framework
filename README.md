## üöÄ Overview

This project moves beyond simple LLM application development into the critical domain of **AI Quality Assurance and MLOps**. It provides a robust, interactive tool for systematically evaluating and comparing the performance of Large Language Models on specific, context-aware tasks.

The framework automates the entire evaluation pipeline, from generating high-quality test data to scoring model responses using an advanced AI judge. It is designed to be a practical tool for prompt engineers, AI developers, and data scientists to make data-driven decisions about which model or system prompt is best suited for their specific use case.

### üéØ Why This Matters

In production environments, the difference between a good and bad LLM configuration can mean:
- üìâ **30-50% reduction** in hallucinations
- üìà **2x improvement** in user satisfaction
- üí∞ **Significant cost savings** through model optimization
- ‚ö° **Faster iteration cycles** with automated testing

## ‚ú® Key Features & Techniques

### ü§ñ Meta-AI (AI-Powered Judging)
Implements a state-of-the-art evaluation strategy where a powerful "judge" LLM (`Gemini 2.5 Pro`) quantitatively scores the responses of other models. This demonstrates a deep understanding of modern LLM evaluation techniques used by companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.

### üìä Multi-Metric Evaluation
The AI judge assesses responses across four critical dimensions:
- **Factual Consistency** (1-5): Alignment with ground truth
- **Helpfulness** (1-5): Practical value to the user
- **Relevance** (1-5): Direct answer to the question
- **Completeness** (1-5): Sufficient detail and coverage

### üé≤ Automated Test Set Generation
Users can provide any text-based context (documentation, articles, knowledge base), and the application uses a powerful LLM to automatically generate a relevant and diverse set of questions and ground-truth answers for testing.

### üîÑ Model & Prompt Benchmarking
The interface allows users to select from multiple available models:
- `Gemini 2.5 Pro` (Most Capable)
- `Gemini 2.0 Flash` (Fast & Efficient)
- `Gemini 1.5 Pro` (Balanced)
- `Gemini 1.5 Flash` (Cost-Effective)
- `Gemini 1.0 Pro` (Legacy)

Customize system prompts to enable direct A/B testing of different configurations.

### üìà Advanced Data Visualization
The dashboard presents evaluation results using sophisticated **Plotly** visualizations:
- **Radar Chart**: High-level overview of model strengths/weaknesses
- **Grouped Bar Charts**: Per-question breakdown of scores
- **Summary Metrics**: Quick performance indicators

### üõ°Ô∏è Robust Engineering Practices
- **API Resilience**: Implements `safe_api_call` wrapper with rate limiting and exponential backoff retry mechanism
- **Error Handling**: Robust JSON parsing and API failure management
- **Security**: Uses environment variables for API keys, no hardcoded secrets
- **User Experience**: Clean UI with spinners, progress bars, and clear feedback
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching to reduce API calls and improve performance

### üíæ Data Export
Download detailed evaluation results as **CSV** or **JSON** for:
- Statistical analysis in Python/R
- Reporting and presentations
- Long-term performance tracking
- Integration with BI tools

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Google AI API key ([Get one here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey))
- `uv` package manager (recommended) or `pip`

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/takzen/llm-evaluation-framework.git
   cd llm-evaluation-framework
   ```

2. **Set up your Google AI API Key:**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file
   echo "GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
   ```
   
   Or manually create a `.env` file with:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   
   **Using `uv` (recommended):**
   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   **Using `pip`:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   
   The application will open automatically in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Provide Context** (Sidebar)
   - Paste any text: documentation, articles, knowledge base content
   - This forms the basis for question generation and evaluation

2. **Configure Parameters** (Sidebar)
   - Select model to test (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro)
   - Choose number of questions (3-20)
   - Click "Generate Test Set"

3. **Review Test Set** (Main Area)
   - Examine generated questions and ground truth answers
   - Ensure quality and relevance

4. **Customize System Prompt** (Main Area)
   - Define how the model should behave
   - Examples: "Be concise", "Provide step-by-step explanations"

5. **Run Evaluation** (Main Area)
   - Click "Run Evaluation & Get AI Judgment"
   - Wait for progress bar (may take 1-2 minutes)

6. **Analyze Results** (Main Area)
   - Review overall metrics and visualizations
   - Examine per-question scores and reasoning
   - Export data for further analysis

### üí° Pro Tips

- **Rate Limiting**: The app includes 7-second delays between API calls to respect rate limits
- **Cost Management**: Start with 3-5 questions for testing, then scale up
- **Prompt Engineering**: Iterate on system prompts based on AI judge feedback
- **Batch Testing**: Export results and compare multiple configurations offline
